film-fingerprints
=================
Takes a video file (only tested with .mkv and .avi), resizes each frame to one pixel wide (maintains the height), and sequentially stitches all the frames together.

See some examples at [http://www.etsy.com/shop/FilmFingerprints](http://www.etsy.com/shop/FilmFingerprints).

Leverages pyffmpeg and PIL.

Only tested on Ubuntu 10.10.
